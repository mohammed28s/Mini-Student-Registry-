🌈 Welcome! A small, friendly student information registry built with Oracle Forms 6i and Oracle PL/SQL — polished with emojis and badges for a warm first impression. 🚀🎨

---

## ✨ Highlights
- 🛠️ Tech: Oracle Forms 6i + Oracle PL/SQL  
- 🧾 Use: Forms (.fmb/.fmx) for UI, PL/SQL libraries (.pll/.plb) for logic  
- 🗄️ DB: Oracle Database (add version to the badge)

## 📋 Quick overview
A lightweight registry app to store and manage student records. GUI is done in Oracle Forms; database & business logic live in PL/SQL. SQL scripts are provided to create schema and seed data.

## 🚀 Getting started
1. 📂 Clone the repo.  
2. 🔧 Open `.fmb` files with Oracle Forms Builder 6i.  
3. 🧩 Compile `.fmb` / `.pll` / `.plb` using Forms Builder/Compiler.  
4. ⚙️ Deploy runtime forms to your Oracle Forms runtime server or use the Forms runtime client.  
5. 🗃️ Run SQL scripts in `plsql/` to create schema and seed data.

## 🗂️ Suggested repository structure
- `forms/`       🖼️ (.fmb and compiled .fmx files)  
- `plsql/`       📜 (.pll / .plb / .sql files)  
- `docs/`        📚 (ER diagrams, setup & deployment instructions)  
- `.gitattributes` 🧭 (maps .fmb/.pll/.sql to PL/SQL for language stats)

## 🎨 Visual & branding options
Want it even more eye-catching? I can:
- Add a custom SVG banner at the top (project logo or gradient).  
- Replace the DB badge with a specific version badge (e.g., 11g / 12c / 19c) and color — examples:
  - 11g: ![11g](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oracle%20DB-11g-orange)  
  - 12c: ![12c](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oracle%20DB-12c-red)  
  - 19c: ![19c](https://img.shields.io/badge/Oracle%20DB-19c-blue)  
- Add a contributors or license badge.  
Tell me which badges/colors you prefer and I’ll update the preview.

## 💡 Tips & notes
- Prefer not to commit compiled `.fmx` unless needed for distribution. Add them only if useful.  
- Add environment and runtime deployment notes in `docs/` (Forms Servlet, WebUtil setup, or client configuration).

## 🤝 Contributing
- Open issues or PRs for improvements, sample forms, or documentation additions.  
- If you want, drop a sample SQL file or PL/SQL library and I’ll add a small example to the repo.

If this looks good, reply with: "push" — and I will apply this README to the repository. If you want any badge text/color changes, database version, or a banner first, tell me what to change and I’ll update the preview. :sparkles:
