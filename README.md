# Mini Student Registry

This project uses Oracle Forms 6i for the front-end and Oracle PL/SQL for database and business logic.

Key technologies:
- Oracle Forms 6i
- Oracle PL/SQL
- Oracle Database (specify your version)

Brief description:
A small student information registry built with Oracle Forms 6i. The Forms (.fmb) contain the UI and call PL/SQL libraries (.pll/.plb) for application logic. SQL scripts (.sql) are included for creating the database schema and seed data.

Running / Notes:
- Open the .fmb files in Oracle Forms Builder 6i to edit.
- Compile .fmb/.pll/.plb using Forms Builder and Forms Compiler as needed.
- Deploy the runtime forms to your Oracle Forms runtime server or use Oracle Forms runtime client.

Repository contents:
- forms/       (put .fmb and compiled .fmx files here)
- plsql/       (.pll / .plb / .sql files)
- docs/        (any docs, ER diagrams, setup instructions)

If you'd like, provide more specific text (database version, runtime instructions) and I'll update the README accordingly.
