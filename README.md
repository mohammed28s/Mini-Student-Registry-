A small, colorful student information registry built with Oracle Forms 6i and Oracle PL/SQL — polished with emojis and useful badges for a friendly README. 🚀🎨

Key technologies:
- 🛠️ Oracle Forms 6i
- 🧾 Oracle PL/SQL
- 🗄️ Oracle Database (specify your version)

Brief description:
A lightweight registry app to store and manage student records. The UI is built in Oracle Forms (.fmb) and application logic lives in PL/SQL libraries (.pll / .plb). SQL scripts (.sql) are provided for creating the schema and seeding sample data.

Getting started:
1. 📂 Clone the repo and open the Forms (.fmb) in Oracle Forms Builder 6i.
2. 🧩 Compile .fmb/.pll/.plb as needed with Forms Builder/Compiler.
3. ⚙️ Deploy runtime forms to your Oracle Forms runtime server or use the Forms runtime client.
4. 🗃️ Run the SQL scripts in the plsql/ directory to create schema and seed data.

Folder structure (suggested):
- forms/       🖼️ (.fmb and compiled .fmx files)
- plsql/       📜 (.pll / .plb / .sql files)
- docs/        📚 (ER diagrams, setup instructions)

Tips & notes:
- 💡 Use Forms Builder 6i to edit Forms and PL/SQL libraries.
- ✅ Add runtime-specific deployment instructions (Forms Servlet, WebUtil, or client config) if you want remote runtime.

Contributing:
- 🤝 Feel free to open issues or PRs with improvements, add sample forms, or include more detailed deployment/docs.

If you want specific badge colors, additional emojis, or a custom database version badge (e.g. 11g/12c/19c), tell me which color and text and I'll update the README again. :sparkles:
